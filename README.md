Robo: Your First AI Voice Assistant
üåü "My First Mega Project, and I love it!" üåü
Overview
Robo is a Python-based voice assistant that listens to your commands, opens websites, plays music from a custom library, and provides audio feedback through speech. This project showcases how Python can be used to build simple AI-powered assistants.

Key Features
Voice Recognition:

Uses speech_recognition to process user commands via a microphone.
Text-to-Speech Responses:

Provides audio feedback using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech).
Website Automation:

Opens commonly used websites like Google, YouTube, Facebook, etc., in your default browser.
Music Control:

Plays music from a custom music library.
Stops the currently playing song when prompted.
Customizable Commands:

Supports specific commands to control its behavior.
Graceful Error Handling:

Handles errors like unrecognized audio, unavailable services, and more.
Getting Started
1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.6 or higher
Required Python libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install speechrecognition webbrowser pyttsx3 gtts pygame
2. Music Library Setup
Create a Python file named musicLibrary.py in the same folder as the main program. Add your songs and their corresponding URLs in this format:

python
Copy code
# Example musicLibrary.py
music = {
    "shape of you": "https://example.com/shape_of_you",
    "perfect": "https://example.com/perfect",
}
Update the song names and links with your favorites!

3. Run the Program
Use the following command to start the assistant:

bash
Copy code
python robo.py
Commands
Wake Word
Say robo to activate the assistant.
Core Commands
Shutdown Robo:
Say:

robo off
Robo will shut down and exit the program.
Open Websites:
Say:

open google
open facebook
open youtube
Robo will open the requested service in your default web browser.
Close All Tabs (Feedback Only):
Say:

close all browser tabs
Robo will inform you that tabs need to be closed manually.
Music Commands
Play a Song:
Say:

play [song name]
Example: play shape of you
Robo will search for the song in your musicLibrary and open its link in a browser.
Stop the Song:
Say:

stop the song
Robo will stop the currently playing song.
Error Handling Commands
If Robo doesn‚Äôt understand a command, it will respond:

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand that command.‚Äù
How It Works
Speech Recognition:

Listens for the wake word (robo) and waits for a command.
Processing Commands:

Matches your input with predefined commands for actions like playing music or opening a website.
Text-to-Speech Feedback:

Responds to your commands using a human-like voice generated by gTTS.
Music Playback:

Uses pygame.mixer to play and stop music.
Customization
Adding More Services:
Update the services dictionary in the main program to add more websites:

python
Copy code
services = {
    "google": "https://google.com",
    "twitter": "https://twitter.com",
    # Add more services here
}
Music Library:
Add or remove songs in musicLibrary.py as needed.

Limitations
Browser Tabs:

Robo can only open tabs. Closing tabs must be done manually.
Speech Accuracy:

Commands might not be recognized in noisy environments or with unclear pronunciation.
Music Playback:

Songs must be added to the musicLibrary with valid URLs.
Future Improvements
Integrate AI models for better command understanding.
Add functionality to directly control browser tabs.
Enhance speech recognition accuracy using advanced libraries like Whisper.
